# Whats new?

I have moved all my pre OpenNept4une work into the archive folder. This includes all my notes for using the BTT Eddy on the Elegoo firmware.

I will be storing my current configs based here soon, but keep in mind that they work with Open Nept4une and my not be advisable for stock Elegoo firware.
