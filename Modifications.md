| Type | Paid | Works? | Notes |
| :--- | ----: | :----: | :---- |
| [Silicone Bushings](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09NNFQQ8T/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) | $7.99 | Y | Springs were not holding position. |
| [Oldham Couplings (x2)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BZ56F15T/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1) | $8.99 | Y | Noticeable improvement in Z banding. |
| [Shroud](https://www.printables.com/model/812526-neptune-4-plus-max-3x-5015-fan-printhead-threaded) | $$ | Y | I could ditch the blower and have improved airflow on the nozzle (where the work happens). I will provide a price later) |
| [EMMC 32Gb](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D1K3TNQN?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title) | $21.00 | Y | Used it for upgrading and storage space. |
